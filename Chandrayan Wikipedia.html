            <b>Chandrayaan-2 </b> (pronunciationⓘ; from Sanskrit: Chandra, "Moon" and yāna, "craft, vehicle"), is the second lunar exploration mission developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), after Chandrayaan-1. It consists of a lunar orbiter, and formerly included the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover, all of which were developed in India. The main scientific objective is to map and study the variations in lunar surface composition, as well as the location and abundance of lunar water.

The spacecraft was launched from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh on 22 July 2019 at 09:13:12 UTC by a LVM3-M1 rocket. The craft reached the lunar orbit on 20 August 2019 and began orbital positioning manoeuvres for the landing of the Vikram lander. The lander and the rover were scheduled to land on the near side of the Moon, in the south polar region at a latitude of about 70° south on 6 September 2019.

However, the lander crashed when it deviated from its intended trajectory while attempting to land on 6 September 2019. According to a failure analysis report submitted to ISRO, the crash was caused by a software glitch.

            On 12 November 2007, representatives of the Roscosmos and ISRO signed an agreement for the two agencies to work together on the Chandrayaan-1's follow-up project, Chandrayaan-2.[16][17] ISRO would have the prime responsibility for the orbiter, rover and the launch by GSLV, while Roscosmos was to provide the lander.[18] The Indian government approved the mission in a meeting of the Union Cabinet, held on 18 September 2008 and chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.[19] The design of the spacecraft was completed in August 2009, with scientists of both countries conducting a joint review.[20]

Although ISRO finalised the payload for Chandrayaan-2 on schedule,[21] the mission was postponed in January 2013 and rescheduled to 2016 because Russia was unable to develop the lander on time.[22][23][24] In 2012, there was a delay in the construction of the Russian lander for Chandrayaan-2 due of the failure of the Fobos-Grunt mission to Mars, since the technical issues connected with the Fobos-Grunt mission which were also used in the lunar projects including the lander for Chandrayaan-2 needed to be reviewed.[23] The changes proposed by Roscosmos necessitated increase in lander mass and required ISRO to decrease mass of its rover and accept some reliability risk.[25][18] When Russia cited its inability to provide the lander even by a revised time-frame of 2015 due to technical and financial reasons, India decided to develop the lunar mission independently.[22][26] With new mission timeline for Chandrayaan-2 and an opportunity for a Mars mission arising with launch window in 2013, unused Chandrayaan-2 orbiter hardware was repurposed to be used for Mars Orbiter Mission.[27]

            Chandrayaan-2 launch had been scheduled for March 2018 initially, but was first delayed to April and then to October 2018 to conduct further tests on the vehicle.[28][29] On 19 June 2018, after the program's fourth Comprehensive Technical Review meeting, a number of changes in configuration[30] and landing sequence[31] were planned for implementation which increased the gross lift-off mass of spacecraft from 3,250 kg to 3,850 kg.[32] Initially an uprated GSLV Mk II[33][34] was the chosen launch vehicle for Chandrayaan-2 but this increased spacecraft mass and issues with launch vehicle upratement[35] forced the launch vehicle to be switched to more capable LVM3.[30] Issues with engine throttling were found during testing[36] pushing the launch to the early 2019[37] and later two of the lander's legs received minor damage during one of the tests in February 2019 delaying the launch even further.

            On 6 September 2019, the lander during its landing phase, deviated from its intended trajectory starting at 2.1 km (1.3 mi) altitude,[44] and had lost communication when touchdown confirmation was expected.[45][46] Initial reports suggesting a crash [47][48] were confirmed by ISRO chairman K. Sivan, stating that "it must have been a hard landing".[49] The Failure Analysis Committee concluded that the crash was caused by a software glitch.[50] Unlike ISRO's previous record, the report of the Failure Analysis Committee has not been made public
